# Atomic Components

A library whose purpose is to replace Material library for designing your own design system. Minimalistic, without bias to a particular design and with a minimum of dependencies.

### Why?

### How to use?

The library is divided into two parts: Atomic and Template.

Atomic components are design-agnostic, meaning they come without pre-defined styling. The only way to style them is through modifiers, which offers great flexibility and convenience. Think of them as pure HTML elements without CSS, but with `appearance: none;` applied.
